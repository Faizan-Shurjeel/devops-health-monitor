# Copy this file to `Secrets.toml` for local development with `cargo shuttle run`.
# Never commit actual secrets.

# Database URL is provisioned by Shuttle in production, but you can set one for local.
# Example for local Postgres:
# DATABASE_URL = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/health_monitor"

# Optional: comma-separated list of initial URLs to seed into the `targets` table on first run.
# SEED_URLS = "https://example.com,https://httpbin.org/status/200"
